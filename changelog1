TODO: Update exit()
1. Add exit status field to process structure in proc.h
2. Change exit system call signature to void exit(int status)
3. Add code in exit() function to update the exit status of the process
    a) Other than this, no other changes should be necessary
4. Update all system calls utilizing exit() to match the new prototype
    a) See files: user.h, defs.h, sysproc.c, proc.c
    b) Note: usertests.c is almost 2000 lines long and has lots of exit() and 
    wait() syscalls; TA told us that we can just remove it from the Makefile 
    and not modify it to make our lives easier.

DONE:
1. (attempted to) Get familiar with exit() syscall flow

TODO: Update wait()
1. Update wait system call signature to int wait(int* status)
    a) Note that wait system call can receive NULL as an argument. In this case 
    the child's exit status must be discarded
